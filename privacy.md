## MediaMod Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to MediaMod (reffered to as 'the mod', 'mod'). We understand how important your privacy is and we only collect data that is absolutely necessary for analytics or for major parts of the mod to function.

### What data do we collect?
When you send a request to the MediaMod API (usually done when connecting with Spotify), no data is stored from that request. The response from the Spotify API is parsed and sent back to your client. This is only done every hour, whenever your client starts up or when you click "Login to Spotify" in Settings.
